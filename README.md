US Census Dataset:

Using the US Census from 1994 (https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/sp15/cse190-c/reports/sp15/048.pdf), explore relationships between several demographic variables, including sex, race, education, etc. and income, where income is a categorical variable (> or < $50,000 per year). 

SMART Questions:

Which variable, race, sex, or education is a bigger predictor of higher income? 

How does education level correlate with the work classes? 

What work classes and incomes correlate with the various non-US nationalities? 


The data is a mix of categorical and continuous variables, so data exploration shall consist of a combination of histograms, violin plots, and other plots. Modeling will be done mainly through linear regression on continuous variables (age and education) for each set of categorical variables (race, sex, workclass)???
